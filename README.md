# Bankruptcy Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting bankruptcy for companies using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, addressing class imbalance, model building, and evaluation using various classification algorithms.

## Contents
- `data1.csv`: The dataset used for modeling.
- `bankruptcy_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Renaming columns
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Handling class imbalance using SMOTE
   - Standardization and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

2. **Model Building**:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Decision Trees
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Confusion matrix
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Accuracy

## Usage
1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Python 3.6 or higher
   - Jupyter Notebook
   - Required libraries: pandas, seaborn, numpy, matplotlib, imblearn, sklearn

2. **Run the Code**:
   - Open `bankruptcy_prediction.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment.
   - Run each cell sequentially to replicate the steps of the project.

3. **Interpretation**:
   - Explore the results of different models.
   - Analyze confusion matrices, precision, recall, and accuracy.

## Notes
- Ensure the dataset `data1.csv` is in the specified path or update the path in the code.
- Experiment with different hyperparameters for models to improve performance.
- Additional feature engineering or different algorithms can be explored for enhancing predictions.
